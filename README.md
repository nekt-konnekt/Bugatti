# BRAG

Product-to-video demo engine.

> Turn what you built into a demo people understand.

## Core rule

**AI should be the director, not the camera.**

BRAG uses the real product as footage. It inspects a product, discovers a bounded workflow, captures real states, builds a demo story, plans motion, generates optional local narration, renders MP4s, and quality-checks the result.

## Pipeline

`build → inspect → discover workflow → capture real footage → direct edit → narrate → render → QA → post`

## v1.5

The Director can now evaluate captured states during the browser run.

After each meaningful state, BRAG classifies the result as:

- `hold-result`: strong proof was found, so the run can stop and preserve the result
- `continue`: the state is meaningful but more evidence is needed
- `replan`: the state contains too little visible evidence

This makes capture adaptive rather than purely step-count driven.

## v1.4

BRAG now creates a Director Shot Plan before browser capture.

The plan defines the intended visual beats:

- establish the real product
- capture the primary action
- capture the core interaction
- capture the proof/result
- hold the useful outcome
- close on the clearest action

The runner records the shot goal alongside each captured interaction. Shot planning is advisory and cannot bypass the browser safety policy.

This separates two decisions:

```text
Director: What moment is worth showing?
Camera:   How can I safely capture it?
```

## v1.3

BRAG now preserves the real browser recording produced by Playwright.

The demo package treats that recording as primary product footage for the product-orientation scene, while state screenshots remain useful for precise workflow/result moments.

Pipeline:

```text
real product
  ↓
Playwright recording
  ↓
Director-guided interaction
  ↓
real browser footage + state evidence
  ↓
edit plan
  ↓
voice
  ↓
render
```

The renderer supports video footage as well as screenshots. This keeps the product visible as it actually behaves instead of turning the entire demo into animated screenshots.

Run:

```bash
npm run demo -- https://your-product.com 4 "What this product does"
npm run edit-plan
npm run voice
npm run render
npm run qa
```

## v1.2

The browser runner is now Director-guided.

Before interacting with a product, BRAG derives the product archetype, promise, strongest visible action, and workflow intent. The runner uses those signals to rank safe actions instead of relying only on generic CTA ordering.

Each selected action records the Director decision and captures the click target coordinates for later visual emphasis.

The safety boundary remains unchanged:

- same-origin navigation only
- bounded step count
- destructive/payment/auth actions blocked
- no form submission
- no arbitrary external navigation

Run:

```bash
npm run run -- https://your-product.com 4
```

## v1.1

BRAG's Director now builds a product-intelligence layer before story selection. It classifies the product archetype, extracts the product promise, identifies the strongest visible action, proposes the core workflow, and defines the proof moment.

Run:

```bash
npm run capture -- https://your-product.com
npm run director
```

The intelligence is deterministic and evidence-based. It does not invent product capabilities that were not observed during inspection.

## v1.0

BRAG now has a local Director QA layer.

Run:

```bash
npm run qa
```

QA checks:

- workflow completion and captured states
- browser console errors
- missing footage
- scene duration validity
- caption length risk
- cursor target bounds
- 16:9, 9:16 and 1:1 MP4 existence
- rendered video dimensions
- rendered video duration
- optional narration assets

Reports:

- `output/qa/report.json`
- `output/qa/report.md`

The report produces a 0–100 score and a release status:

- **PASS**: no detected production issues
- **WARNING**: usable, but human review is required
- **FAIL**: do not hand off the MP4 yet

A clean QA report is not a substitute for watching the final video. BRAG is a production assistant, not an autonomous publisher.

## v0.9

Local Piper TTS remains optional:

```bash
PIPER_MODEL=/path/to/voice.onnx npm run voice
npm run render
npm run qa
```

Without Piper, BRAG can render silent video.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm start
```

Then use `http://localhost:4173`.

For the production pipeline:

```bash
npm run demo -- https://your-product.com 4 "What this product does"
npm run edit-plan
# optional
PIPER_MODEL=/path/to/voice.onnx npm run voice
npm run render
npm run qa
```

Outputs live under `output/`.

BRAG is personal and local. No accounts, billing, tenants, or SaaS layer.


## Clean CLI

The production pipeline now has an explicit CLI instead of relying on positional argument discovery.

Show help:

```bash
npm run brag -- --help
```

Typical run:

```bash
npm run brag -- --url https://your-product.com --steps 4 --description "What this product does"
```

Useful controls:

- `--max-revisions 2` bounds autonomous repair
- `--override output/demo/override.json` supplies bounded human edits
- `--check` runs the environment/hardening check only

The legacy positional form remains supported:

```bash
npm run brag -- https://your-product.com 4 "What this product does"
```

## Final production package

A successful run creates `output/final/` containing the three video formats and the production evidence/QA artifacts.

BRAG also writes:

- `output/final/brag-package.json` with SHA-256 checksums
- `output/final/README.txt` with handoff contents

Package an existing final directory with:

```bash
npm run package-output
```

The package is a deterministic folder handoff rather than a proprietary archive, so the artifacts remain directly inspectable and auditable.
